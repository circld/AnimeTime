# It's Anime Time!
## Description
This script was originally conceived of as a command-line utility to directly access freely available streaming anime videos. It can easily be extended to handle additional video sources by creating a new class for this website that subclasses the Site class.

n.b. The location of your default Firefox profile must be saved to profile_path.txt in the same directory as animetime.py (for now).

## Dependencies
The primary dependencies are Selenium and the Firefox web browser. argparse is also required.
